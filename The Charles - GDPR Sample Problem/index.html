            <p> ðŸ”‘ I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water
            is the healing. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. Wraith talk. Always remember in the jungle thereâ€™s
            a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to paradise. Donâ€™t ever play yourself. They key is to
            have every key, the key to open every door. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they donâ€™t want us
            to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast.</p>
            <hr/>
            <p> ðŸ”‘ They donâ€™t want us to win. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to
            eat and they donâ€™t want you to eat. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years
            of blood sweat and tears, and Iâ€™m never giving up, Iâ€™m just getting started. The key to more success is to get a massage
            once a week, very important, major key, cloth talk. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it
            to paradise, thatâ€™s the key, Lion!</p>
            <hr/>
            <p> ðŸ”‘ The key to more success is to get a massage once a week, very important, major key, cloth talk. The key is to enjoy
            life, because they donâ€™t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they donâ€™t want you to jetski, they donâ€™t want you to
            smile. Always remember in the jungle thereâ€™s a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to
            paradise. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel.</p>
            <hr/>
            <p> ðŸ”‘ They donâ€™t want us to win. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key.
            Another one. Mogul talk. To be successful youâ€™ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, youâ€™ve got to make it. They
            donâ€™t want us to win. Give thanks to the most high. They will try to close the door on you, just open it. The key to
            success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo?
            Ainâ€™t nothinâ€™ like bamboo. Bless up. Letâ€™s see what Chef Dee got that they donâ€™t want us to eat.</p>
